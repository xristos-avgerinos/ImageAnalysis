# ImageAnalysis
A Python project that was developed as a university assignment for the subject of Image Analysis.

The goal of this work was to develop graph-theoretic algorithms for content-based image retrieval. 
The basic steps of the proposed algorithmic approach are as follows:
1. Rank Normalization
2. Hypergraph Construction
3. Calculating Hyperedge Similarities
4. Calculation of the Cartesian Product between the elements of the Hyperedges
5. Calculation of Similarity based on the constructed Hypergraph (Hypergraph â€“ Based Similarity)

 **Group members involved in this project:**<br>
 Athanasios Bitakis, Dimitrios Panagiotopoulos, Avgerinos Christos.
