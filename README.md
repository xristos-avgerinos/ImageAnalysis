# ImageAnalysis
A Python project that was developed as a university assignment for the subject of "Image Analysis".

The goal of this computational task was to develop graph-theoretic algorithms for content-based image retrieval. The basic steps of the proposed algorithmic approach are as follows:
1. Rank Normalization
2. Hypergraph Construction
3. Hyperedge Similarities
4. Cartesian Product of Hyperedge Elements
5. Hypergraph â€“ Based Similarity

 **Group members involved in this project:**<br>
 Athanasios Bitakis, Dimitrios Panagiotopoulos, Avgerinos Christos.
